        Performs the UCB1 bandit learning algorith.

        Addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in MCTS:
        every time a node (action) is to be selected within the existing tree, the choice
        may be modelled as an independent multi-armed bandit problem.
        The output is guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the best possible bound on
        the growth of regret.

        The value c_ucb1 = 1/âˆš2 was shown by Kocsis and Szepesvari to satisfy
        the Hoeffding ineqality with rewards in the range [0, 1].
